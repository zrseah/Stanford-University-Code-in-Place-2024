# Instruction 
In this problem, we'll animate a simple gondola lift. Here's a real-life gondola lift -- you enter the little capsule at the bottom and it slowly draws you up the mountain to the top.

Run the starter code and note the diagonal line and the square (our "gondola") at the bottom left. Your job is to animate the square so its top left corner follows the line up and to the right in NUM_STEPS steps. You should use NUM_STEPS along with lift_width and lift_height to calculate how much you want to move the square up and to the right in each iteration.
