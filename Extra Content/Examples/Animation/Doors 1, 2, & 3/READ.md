# Instruction 

When we make graphics-based programs it can be very important to know where our mouse is when we click. Sometimes, the mouse may be over a button, a checkbox, or other various graphical user interface (GUI) features.

To familiarize yourself with this concept, we have already provided three different doors and a function to open them. All we need to know is which door to open! Fill out the get_door_clicked(...) which checks to see which door to open based on where you click the mouse.

# Doors 1, 2 & 3
