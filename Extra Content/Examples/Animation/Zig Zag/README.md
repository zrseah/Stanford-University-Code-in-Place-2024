# Instruction 
First run the starter code to see what you're working with. 

Write code which moves the square in a zig zag pattern -- always move right; before you reach FIRST_ZIG_X you should be moving downwards, and then between FIRST_ZIG_X and SECOND_ZIG_X you should be moving upwards, and then after SECOND_ZIG_X you should once again move downwards. 

In other words, the upper left corner of the square should follow the blue line! 
Please make use of the VELOCITY constant to move that much up / down / left / right in each iteration of the loop.
