# Game of Hangman 

This project is the culmination of my work for the Code in Place 2024 course. Throughout this six-week program, I have applied my knowledge of dictionaries, lists, loops, graphics, and more.

The project is a digital rendition of Hangman. Players are prompted to enter their guesses each round, and with every incorrect guess, an additional part of a stick figure is drawn. The game concludes with a loss if the entire stick figure is completed. Conversely, the player wins if they successfully guess the word before the figure is fully drawn.
