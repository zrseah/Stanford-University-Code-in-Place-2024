# Game of Hangman 

This project is a digital version of Hangman. Players are asked to enter their guesses each round. With each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn. 
The game ends in a loss if the entire stick figure is completed. Conversely, if the player successfully guesses the word before the figure is fully drawn, they win.
